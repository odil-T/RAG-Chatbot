3. Make A New Environment - Navigate into the cloned repository directory with `cd RAG-Chatbot` and run `pip install virtualenv`. Run `virtualenv chat_app` to make a new virtual environment. Run `chat_app\Scripts\activate` in Windows or `source chat_app/bin/activate` in Mac/Linux to activate the environment.
